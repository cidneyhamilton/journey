Journey: An online survey application
Copyright (C) 2006-2009 Nat Budin

WELCOME TO JOURNEY

Journey is an online survey application.  It provides an AJAX-based
graphical interface for creating surveys, and lets people respond to
them via the web.  Journey also provides tools for analyzing the
responses to your surveys.

INSTALLATION

Journey is a Ruby on Rails application, and uses standard Rails
deployment techniques.  We have tested Journey using a MySQL database
backend; theoretically, it should work with other databases, but this
is not officially supported.

Briefly, the procedure for deploying Journey is:

1) Write a config/database.yml file.  You'll need to configure at
   least a development or production database (depending on the type
   of environment you're deploying to), and you'll also need to
   specify a "users" database.  This can be the same as your main
   Journey database, or a different one.  If you want to share users
   and roles between different ae_users-based applications, you'll
   probably want to use a separate database.

2) Make sure you have the gems installed that Journey needs.  To do
   this, simply run "rake gems:install" as root, and Rails will find
   and install the gems it needs.

3) Run "git submodule update --init" in the application root, in
   order to pull in the ae_users plugin.

4) Run "rake db:migrate" to create the Journey tables.  If you're
   using a production database, this should be 
   "rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production" instead.

5) Create the database tables needed by the ae_users plugin.  (See
   the plugin docs for details.)
   
6) Start the Journey application server.  Go to the front page using
   a web browser and verify that it works.

7) Sign up for an initial user account.  (Click the "Sign up" link
   in the upper right corner.)

8) Shut down Journey temporarily, and give yourself universal admin
   privileges in the database.  To do this, insert a row into the
   "permissions" table.  All you need to fill in is the "person_id"
   column using the ID from the ae_users "people" table - leave all
   the other columns as NULL.

9) Start up Journey again.  You should now be an administrator.
